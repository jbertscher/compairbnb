The apartment is located opposite a cosy and lively town square with several restaurants. The perfect location for a short or long stay in the design and technology capital of the Netherlands.\n\nThe health, safety and well-being of my guests is a top priority. I use stricter hygiene measures.\n\nThe studio of approximately 22 square meters is one of two luxury studio apartments on the first floor of a completely renovated and well-kept townhouse build in 1921. \n\nCurrently, I am happy to receive guests again in one of the two luxurious Airbnb studios so that my maximum of two guests have all the space that is currently required. I use extra hygiene and the 1.5 meter guidelines. We will discuss this clearly and clearly during the personal check in. \n\nA lot of attention has been paid to the comfort of the bedroom, upholstery and decoration. A grand hotel bed is equipped with luxurious Walra bed linen. This lovely comfortable bed guarantees a wonderful night's sleep. \n\nDarkened hotel curtains provide relaxation by keeping the lights and sounds of the cosy street outside. This studio has a kitchen with all the necessary amenities and a bar with bar stools for dinning. Walra bathrobes and towels are provided for in the studio.\n\nYou do not currently share the common bathroom with toilet. Now completely private as the other duplex studio is closed. I decide to take extra hygiene measures in the bathroom. At the moment, guests should always close the bathroom door when using the bathroom, which guarantees the 1.5 meter guidelines.\n\nYou have free access to secure WIFI after a password has been specified.

Of course, personal welcome and key transfer are self-evident. Next, I would like to walk with you through the studio and answer any questions. You will find a complimentary welcome drink on the table in the room. During your stay, I regularly attend on the first floor in my studio, but please feel free to go your own way. I am available, feel free to call, email or preferably send me a message on my cell phone.\n\nThe studio is located opposite a cosy town square with several restaurants and Pand P, the former cultural center Plaza Futura.

The Parktheater is directly adjacent to the Stadswandelpark, where you can walk and enjoy the sculptures.

In just 15 minutes you walk to the car-free shopping streets around the Heuvelgalerie, the Bijenkorf or Piazza Center, where all the famous stores can be found. At 100 meters from the front door opposite supermarket Albert Heijn you will find Eindhoven Heistraat bus stop where buses run on lines 11 and 17. Walk the other way, and you will find after 250 meter the bus stop Looiakkersstraat where line 7, line 117, line 317, line 318 and line 407 can be found.\n\nOrder a breakfast at the true artisan baker Renders, Subway or at a real Dutch cheese shop.
